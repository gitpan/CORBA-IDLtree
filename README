Installation of IDLtree:

Let $LIBTOP be the directory root to where the perl library was installed 
on your system (usually, this is /usr/lib/perl5 or /usr/local/lib/perl5.)

1. Create the directory $LIBTOP/CORBA if it doesn't exist yet.

2. Copy the ./CORBA/IDLtree.pm file into $LIBTOP/CORBA

Usage of the demo application:

Assuming you are in the ./demoapp directory and have a myfile.idl there,

   perl idl2ada.pl myfile.idl

will make the IDL to Ada translator generate various Ada files.
